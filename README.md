# Restart Explorer

Of course, the Windows shell never locks up, but if it did, it would be nice if
there was an easier way to restart it than opening task manager, killing the
process and then running a new explorer.exe process.

**Usage:** Run RestartExplorer.exe from the command line or hit Windows+R and run
from there.
